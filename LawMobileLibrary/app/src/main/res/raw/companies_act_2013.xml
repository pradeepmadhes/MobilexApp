<section id="325" sno="325" value="325 : Application of insolvency rules in winding up of insolvent companies.">
<content> (1) In the winding up of an insolvent company, the same rules shall prevail and be
observed with regard to-
(a) debts provable;
(b) the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities; and
(c) the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors,
as are in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of
persons adjudged insolvent:
Provided that the security of every secured creditor shall be deemed to be subject to a
paripassucharge in favour of the workmen to the extent of the workmen's portion therein,
and, where a secured creditor, instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debts,
opts to realise his security,-
(i) the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such
charge;
(ii) any amount realised by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charge
shall be applied rateably for the discharge of workmen's dues; and
(iii) so much of the debts due to such secured creditor as could not be realised
by him or the amount of the workmen's portion in his security, whichever is less, shall
rank paripassuwith the workmen's dues for the purposes of section 326.
(2) All persons under sub-section (1) shall be entitled to prove and receive dividends
out of the assets of the company under winding up, and make such claims against the
company as they respectively are entitled to make by virtue of this section:
Provided that if a secured creditor, instead of relinquishing his security and proving
his debts, proceeds to realise his security, he shall be liable to pay his portion of the expenses
incurred by the liquidator, including a provisional liquidator, if any, for the preservation of
the security before its realisation by the secured creditor.
Explanation.-For the purposes of this sub-section, the portion of expenses incurred
by the liquidator for the preservation of a security which the secured creditor shall be liable
to pay shall be the whole of the expenses less an amount which bears to such expenses the
same proportion as the workmen's portion in relation to the security bears to the value of the
security.
(3) For the purposes of this section, section 326 and section 327,-
(a) 'workmen', in relation to a company, means the employees of the company,
being workmen within the meaning of clause (s) of section 2 of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947;
(b) 'workmen's dues'-, in relation to a company, means the aggregate of the
following sums due from the company to its workmen, namely:-
(i) all wages or salary including wages payable for time or piece work and
salary earned wholly or in part by way of commission of any workman in respect
of services rendered to the company and any compensation payable to any
workman under any of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947;
(ii) all accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable to any workman
or, in the case of his death, to any other person in his right on the termination of
his employment before or by the effect of the winding up order or resolution;
(iii) unless the company is being wound up voluntarily merely for the
purposes of reconstruction or amalgamation with another company or unless
the company has, at the commencement of the winding up, under such a contract
with insurers as is mentioned in section 14 of the Workmen-s Compensation Act,
1923, rights capable of being transferred to and vested in the workmen, all amount
due in respect of any compensation or liability for compensation under the said
Act in respect of the death or disablement of any workman of the company;
(iv) all sums due to any workman from the provident fund, the pension
fund, the gratuity fund or any other fund for the welfare of the workmen,
maintained by the company;
(c) -workmen's portion', in relation to the security of any secured creditor of a
company, means the amount which bears to the value of the security the same proportion
as the amount of the workmen's dues bears to the aggregate of the amount of workmen's
dues and the amount of the debts due to the secured creditors.
Illustration
The value of the security of a secured creditor of a company is Rs. 1,00,000. The total
amount of the workmen's dues is Rs. 1,00,000. The amount of the debts due from the company
to its secured creditors is Rs. 3,00,000. The aggregate of the amount of workmen's dues and
the amount of debts due to secured creditors is Rs. 4,00,000. The workmen's portion of the
security is, therefore, one-fourth of the value of the security, that is Rs. 25,000.

provisions of this section, by writing signed by him, at any time within twelve months after
the commencement of the winding up or such extended period as may be allowed by the
Tribunal, disclaim the property:
Provided that where the Company Liquidator had not become aware of the existence of
any such property within one month from the commencement of the winding up, the power
of disclaiming the property may be exercised at any time within twelve months after he has
become aware thereof or such extended period as may be allowed by the Tribunal.

of the company from liability, affect the rights, interest or liabilities of any other person.

be given to persons interested, and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and
make such other order in the matter as the Tribunal considers just and proper.
(4) The Company Liquidator shall not be entitled to disclaim any property in any case
where an application in writing has been made to him by any person interested in the
property requiring him to decide whether he will or will not disclaim and the Company
Liquidator has not, within a period of twenty-eight days after the receipt of the application or
such extended period as may be allowed by the Tribunal, give notice to the applicant that he
intends to apply to the Tribunal for leave to disclaim, and in case the property is under a
contract, if the Company Liquidator after such an application as aforesaid does not within
the said period or extended period disclaim the contract, he shall be deemed to have adopted it.

Liquidator, entitled to the benefit or subject to the burden of a contract made with the
company, make an order rescinding the contract on such terms as to payment by or to either
party of damages for the non-performance of the contract, or otherwise as the Tribunal
considers just and proper, and any damages payable under the order to any such person may

in any disclaimed property or is under any liability not discharged under this Act in respect
of any disclaimed property, and after hearing any such persons as it thinks fit, make an order
for the vesting of the property in, or the delivery of the property to, any person entitled
thereto or to whom it may seem just that the property should be delivered by way of
compensation for such liability as aforesaid, or a trustee for him, and on such terms as the
Tribunal considers just and proper, and on any such vesting order being made, the property
comprised therein shall vest accordingly in the person named therein in that behalf without
any conveyance or assignment for the purpose:
Provided that where the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature, the Tribunal shall
not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the company, whether as
under-lessee or as mortgagee or holder of a charge by way of demise, except upon the terms
of making that person-
(a) subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those to which the company
was subject under the lease in respect of the property at the commencement of the
winding up; or
(b) if the Tribunal thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as
if the lease had been assigned to that person at that date,
and in either event as if the lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting
order, and any mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such
terms shall be excluded from all interest in, and security upon the property, and, if there is no
person claiming under the company who is willing to accept an order upon such terms, the
Tribunal shall have power to vest the estate and interest of the company in the property in
any person liable, either personally or in a representative character, and either alone or jointly
with the company, to perform the covenants of the lessee in the lease, free and discharged
from all estates, encumbrances and interests created therein by the company.
(7) Any person affected by the operation of a disclaimer under this section shall be
deemed to be a creditor of the company to the amount of the compensation or damages
