(b) A dies intestate and in debt to B, C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects from C : In a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, the latter cannot set-off the debt against the price, for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as representative to A.

(c) A sues B on a bill of exchange : B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is liable to him in compensation which he claims to set-off : The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off.

(d) A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs : 500 : B holds a judgment against A for Rs : 1,000 : The two claims being both definite, pecuniary demands may be set-off.

(e) A sues B for compensation on account of trespass : B holds a promissory note for Rs : 1,000 from A and claims to set-off that amount against any sum that A may recover in the suit : B may do so, for as soon as A recovers, both sums are definite pecuniary demands.

(f) A and B sue C for Rs : 1,000 C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone.

(g) A sues B and C for Rs : 1000 : B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A.

(h) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs : 1,000 B dies, leaving C surviving : A sues C for a debt of Rs : 1,500 due in his separate character : C may set-off the debt of Rs : 1,000.

Illustrations

(b) B sues A under the circumstance mentioned in illustration (a) : On the plaint being filed, A disputes the claim : Afterwards A pays the money into Court : B accepts it in full satisfaction of his claim : The Court should also give B his cast of suit : A's conduct having shown that the litigation was necessary.
