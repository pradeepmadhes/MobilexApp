<p>(1) In this Constitution, the expression “Scheduled Areas” means such areas
as the President may by order declare to be Scheduled Areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(2) The President may at any time by order</p>

<p>&nbsp;(a) Direct that the whole or any specified part of a Scheduled Area
shall cease to be a Scheduled Area or a part of such an area;</p>

<p>&nbsp;(aa) Increase the area of any Scheduled Area in a State after
consultation with the Governor of that State;</p>

<p>&nbsp;(b) Alter, but only by way of rectification of boundaries, any
Scheduled Area;</p>

<p>&nbsp;(c) On any alteration of the boundaries of a State or on the admission
into the Union or the establishment of a new State, declare any territory not
previously included in any State to be, or to form part of, a Scheduled Area;</p>

<p>&nbsp;(d) Rescind, in relation to any State or States, any order or orders
made under this paragraph, and in consultation with the Governor of the State
concerned, make fresh orders redefining the areas which are to be Scheduled Areas;</p>

<p>&nbsp;And any such order may contain such incidental and consequential
provisions as appear to the President to be necessary and proper, but save as
aforesaid, the order made under sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall not
be varied by any subsequent order.</p>
