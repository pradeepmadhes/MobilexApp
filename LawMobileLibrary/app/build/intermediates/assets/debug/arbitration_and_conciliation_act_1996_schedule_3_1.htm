<p class=bodypost style='border:none;padding:0in'><span lang=EN-IN>(1) In the
territories of any High Contracting Party to which the present Convention
applies, an arbitral award made in pursuance of an agreement, whether relating
to existing or future differences (hereinafter called “a submission to
arbitration”) covered by the Protocol on Arbitration Clauses opened at Geneva
on September 24th, 1923, shall be recognised as binding and shall be enforced
in accordance with the rules of the procedure of the territory where the award
is relied upon, provided that the said award has been made in a territory of
one of the High Contracting Parties to which the present Convention applies and
between persons who are subject to the jurisdiction of one of the High Contracting
Parties.<br>
<br>
(2) To obtain such recognition or enforcement, it shall, further, be necessary—<br>
<br>
(a) that the award has been made in pursuance of a submission to arbitration
which is valid under the law applicable thereto;<br>
<br>
(b) that the subject-matter of the award is capable of settlement by
arbitration under the law of the country in which the award is sought to be
relied upon;<br>
<br>
(c) that the award has been made by the Arbitral Tribunal provided for in the
submission to arbitration or constituted in the manner agreed upon by the
parties and in conformity with the law governing the arbitration procedure;<br>
<br>
(d) that the award has become final in the country in which it has been made,
in the sense that it will not be considered as such if it is open to
opposition, appeal or pourvoi en cassation (in the countries where such forms
of procedure exist) or if it is proved that any proceedings for the purpose of
contesting the validity of the award are pending;<br>
<br>
(e) that the recognition or enforcement of the award is not contrary to the
public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in which it is
sought to be relied upon.</span></p>
