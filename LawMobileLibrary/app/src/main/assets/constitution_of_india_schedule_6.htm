orders, direct that such consequential amendments as are necessary to give
effect to the provisions of this clause shall be made in paragraph 20 of this
Schedule (including Part III of the table appended to that paragraph) and
thereupon the said paragraph and the said Part III shall be deemed to have been
amended accordingly;</p>
