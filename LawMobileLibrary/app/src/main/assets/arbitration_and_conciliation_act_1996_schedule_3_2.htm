<p class=bodypost style='border:none;padding:0in'><span lang=EN-IN>Even if the
conditions laid down in Article 1 hereof are fulfilled, recognition and
enforcement of the award shall be refused if the court is satisfied—<br>
<br>
(a) that the award has been annulled in the country in which it was made;<br>
<br>
(b) that the party against whom it is sought to use the award was not given
notice of the arbitration proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to present
his case; or that, being under a legal incapacity, he was not properly
represented;<br>
<br>
(c) that the award does not deal with the differences contemplated by or
falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or that it contains
decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.<br>
<br>
If the award has not covered all the questions submitted to the arbitral
tribunal, the competent authority of the country where recognition or
enforcement of the award is sought can, if it thinks fit, postpone such
recognition or enforcement or grant it subject to such guarantee as that
authority may decide.<br>
