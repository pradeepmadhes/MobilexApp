(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house, B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment, provided for that offence
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft
Explanation 4 : The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence
Illustration- A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment
Explanation 5 : It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed
Illustration- A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z It is agreed that A shall administer the poison B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder

<content>Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide
Illustrations- (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused Z believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed A has committed the offence of culpable homicide
(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush B does not know it A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush B fires and kills Z Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide
(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death
Explanation 1 : A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death
Explanation 2 : Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented
Explanation 3 : The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born
</content>
</section>

<section id="300" sno="337" value="300 : Murder.">
<content>Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or
2ndlyIf it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or
3rdlyIf it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or
4thlyIf the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid
Illustrations- (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him Z dies in consequence A commits murder
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury Z dies in consequence of the blow A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death
(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature Z dies in consequence Here, A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death
(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual
Exception 1When culpable homicide is not murderCulpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident
The above exception is subject to the following provisos:
FirstThat the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person
SecondlyThat the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant
ThirdlyThat the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence
Explanation : Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact
Illustrations- (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation
(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight A kills Z Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide
(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers
(d) A appears as witness before Z, a Magistrate, Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z This is murder
(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose, Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence
(f) Z strikes B B is by this provocation excited to violent rage A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose B kills Z with the knife Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder
Exception 2Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence
Illustration- Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A A draws out a pistol Z persists in the assault A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide
Exception 3Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused
Exception 4Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner
Explanation : It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault
Exception 5Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent
Illustration- A, by instigation, voluntarily causes, Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder

Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter described:
FirstBy his own bodily power
SecondlyBy disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person

Illustrations- (a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced without any other act on any person's part A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z
(b) Z is riding in a chariot A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace Here Z has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's consent, intending, or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z
(c) Z is riding in a palanquin A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence A has used criminal force to Z
(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z
(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried by Z Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes A has used force to Z; and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy ,Z, he has criminal force by Z

Explanation : Mere words do not amount to an assault But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault
Illustrations- (a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike Z, A has committed an assault
(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z A has committed an assault upon Z
(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, I will give you a beating Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the gesture explained by the words may amount to an assault

<section id="378" sno="433" value="378 : Theft.">
<content>Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft
Explanation 1 : A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth
Explanation 2 : A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft
Explanation 3 : A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it
Explanation 4 : A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal
Explanation 5 : The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied
Illustrations- (a) A cuts down a tree on Z's around, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft
(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A
(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure
(d) A, being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent A has committed theft
(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of the warehouse, till Z shall return A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it Here the plate was not in Z's possession It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust
(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft
(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person A by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property
(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft
(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated Z carries it to his shop A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly
(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly
(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly
(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession, without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft
(m) A, being, on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft
(n) A asks charity from Z's wife She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft
(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft
(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft

<content>In all robbery there is either theft or extortion
When theft is robberyTheft is robbery if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint
When extortion is robberyExtortion is robbery if the offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted
Explanation : The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint
Illustrations- (a) A holds Z down and fraudulently takes Z's money and jewels from Z's clothes without Z's consent Here A has committed theft, and in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z A has therefore committed robbery
(b) A meets Z on the high roads, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse Z in consequence, surrenders his purse Here A has extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence A has therefore committed robbery
(c) A meets Z and Z's child on the high road A takes the child and threatens to fling it down a precipice, unless Z delivers his purse Z, in consequence delivers his purse Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child who is there present A has therefore committed robbery on Z
(d) A obtains property from Z by saying- Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us ten thousand rupees This is extortion, and punishable as such; but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child

<content>Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both
Illustrations- (a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing, at any time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section
(c) A and B, being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending, to use it Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section

What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found

<section id="464" sno="519" value="464 : Making a false document.">
<content>A person is said to make a false document or false electronic record
FirstWho dishonestly or fraudulently
    (a) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document; 
    (b) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;
    (c) affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record;
    (d) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the electronic signature,
with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of document, electronic record or electronic signature was made, signed, sealed executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed; or
SecondlyWho, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof, after it has been made, executed or affixed with electronic signature either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such alteration; or
ThirdlyWho dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any electronic record knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practised upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the alteration
Illustrations- (a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000 written by Z A, in order to defraud B, adds a cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be delivered by B that Z so wrote the letter A has committed forgery
(b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention to selling the estate to B, and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money A has committed forgery
(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker-signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees A commits forgery
(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payment B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees B commits forgery
(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery
(f) Z's will contains the these words-I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C A has committed forgery
(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words Pay to Z or his order and signing the endorsement B dishonestly erases the words Pay to Z or his order, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement B commits forgery
(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z A has committed forgery
(i) Z dictates his will to A A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will A has committed forgery
(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property A has committed forgery
(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service
Explanation 1 : A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery
Illustrations- (a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name A has committed forgery
(b) A writes the word accepted on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery
(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery
(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate of Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it
(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition
Explanation 2 : The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery
Illustration- A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it A commits forgery
Explanation 3 : For the purposes of this section, the expression affixing electronic signature shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000)
