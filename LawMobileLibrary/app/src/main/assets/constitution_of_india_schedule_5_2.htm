<p>&nbsp;4. Tribes Advisory Council. -</p>

<p>(1) There shall be established in each State having Scheduled Areas therein
and, if the President so directs, also in any State having Scheduled Tribes but
not Scheduled Areas therein, a Tribes Advisory Council consisting of not more
than twenty members of whom, as nearly as may be, three-fourths shall be the
representatives of the Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the
State: </p>

<p>&nbsp;Provided that if the number of representatives of the Scheduled Tribes
in the Legislative Assembly of the State is less than the number of seats in
the Tribes Advisory Council to be filled by such representatives, the remaining
seats shall be filled by other members of those tribes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(2) It shall be the duty of the Tribes Advisory Council to advise on
such matters pertaining to the welfare and advancement of the Scheduled Tribes
in the State as may be referred to them by the Governor. </p>

<p>&nbsp;(3) The Governor  may make rules prescribing or regulating, as the
case may be, -</p>

<p>&nbsp;(a) The number of members of the Council, the mode of their
appointment and the appointment of the Chairman of the Council and of the
officers and servants thereof;</p>

<p>&nbsp;(b) The con<br>
duct of its meetings and its procedure in general; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;(c) All other incidental matters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;5. Law applicable to Scheduled Areas. -</p>

<p>(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Governor  may by
public notification direct that any particular Act of Parliament or of the
Legislature of the State shall not apply to a Scheduled Area or any part
thereof in the State or shall apply to a Scheduled Area or any part thereof in
the State subject to such exceptions and modifications as he may specify in the
notification and any direction given under this sub-paragraph may be given so
as to have retrospective effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(2) The Governor  may make regulations for the peace and good
government of any area in a State which is for the time being a Scheduled Area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing
power, such regulations may-</p>

<p>&nbsp;(a) Prohibit or restrict the transfer of land by or among members of
the Scheduled Tribes in such area;</p>

<p>&nbsp;(b) Regulate the allotment of land to members of the Scheduled Tribes
in such area;</p>

<p>&nbsp;(c) Regulate the carrying on of business as money-lender by persons
who lend money to members of the Scheduled Tribes in such area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(3) In making any such regulation as is referred to in sub-paragraph (2) of
this paragraph, the Governor  may repeal or amend any Act of Parliament or of
the Legislature of the State or any existing law which is for the time being
applicable to the area in question.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(4) All regulations made under this paragraph shall be submitted
forthwith to the President and, until assented to by him, shall have no effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(5) No regulation shall be made under this paragraph unless the
Governor  making the regulation has, in the case where there is a Tribes
Advisory Council for the State, consulted such Council.</p>
